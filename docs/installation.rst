.. _`Installation`:

Installation
============

Generally, the installation procedure is basically the same
for all platforms.
You can install ``pixelart`` directly using ``pip``, which 
should come with modern Python versions. You need Python 3
in order to run this script.

Windows
-------

- Install Python 3. Be sure to install ``Tcl`` and ``Tk``.
- Open the python prompt.
- Install with ``pip`` by executing the command
  ``pip install pixelart``.
- To use the gui, use the command ``pixelart-gui`` in the
  python prompt.

Linux
-----

- Install Python 3, ``numpy``, and ``pillow``, as well as
  ``Tcl`` and ``Tk`` if not yet installed.
- Use ``pip`` to install, e.g. ``pip install pixelart``.
- To use the gui, use the command ``pixelart-gui`` in the
  python prompt. The command ``pixelart`` provides an 
  interface usable in the shell.

OS X
----

- Follow same instructions as Linux.
